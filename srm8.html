                    <p>
                        This study tackles the difficulty of quantifying human-cantered attacks by combining attack trees (for occurrence likelihood) and Markov chains (for success likelihood), both grounded in persuasion principles and communication modes. Its findings can directly inform policy, training, and awareness strategies to mitigate social engineering risks.

                    <p>
                        Hi Matthew,<br><br>
                        I really like the way you explained the weaknesses of CVSS and how you linked them to the updates in version 4.0. I agree with you that even though CVSS is widely used by groups like NIST and PCI DSS, the problems with context and scoring remain. As you mention, many users are not familiar with the detailed metrics, so the environmental scores in CVSS v4 are hard to apply (Aggarwal, 2023). This limits how useful the system is in practice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your suggestion to combine CVSS with EPSS is a strong one. EPSS is designed to predict the chance of a vulnerability being exploited in the real world (FIRST, 2025). This is important because research has shown that many vulnerabilities with high CVSS scores are never actually exploited, while some lower-scoring ones are (Allodi & Massacci, 2012). By using EPSS alongside CVSS, organisations can prioritise vulnerabilities that are both serious and likely to be attacked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A good way to prevent incidents would be to build this combined approach into patch management. For example, if a vulnerability has a medium CVSS score but a high EPSS score, it should be patched quickly. On the other hand, if a vulnerability has a high CVSS score but a very low EPSS score, it could be scheduled for later. This makes sure limited resources are used where they are needed most.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your idea shows that while CVSS may remain part of security practice, using EPSS alongside it makes decision-making more realistic and effective.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hi Ameirah,<br><br>
                        I really enjoyed reading your post. You explain clearly why CVSS is limited, especially in how it compresses complex risks into a single number. I agree with your point that this can mislead organisations because the same score may mean very different things depending on the environment. As you mention, studies have shown that many vulnerabilities with high CVSS scores are not actually exploited, while some lower-scoring ones become the basis of major incidents (Allodi and Massacci, 2017). This shows that using CVSS alone is not enough to guide practical decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also think your choice of SSVC as a replacement is a strong one. By focusing on decision trees and context, SSVC helps different groups (suppliers, deployers, and coordinators) decide what action is appropriate (Spring et al., 2021). This avoids the ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù weakness of CVSS. A useful measure for preventing incidents would be to adopt SSVC alongside live threat intelligence feeds. For example, if a vulnerability is actively being exploited, SSVC can guide an organisation to treat it as ‚Äúimmediate,‚Äù even if its CVSS score is only moderate. This combination could reduce the risk of overlooking threats that do not appear severe at first glance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your argument shows that moving from static scoring to context-based decision-making is essential. SSVC is not only more flexible but also more transparent, which helps security teams explain and justify their priorities to stakeholders.
                    </p>

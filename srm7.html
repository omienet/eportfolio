                    <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
                    <h3>Initial Post</h3>
                    <p>
                        Spring et al. (2021) point out several problems with the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). 
                        First, CVSS mainly looks at technical severity, without taking into account the different needs of those 
                        who must deal with vulnerabilities, such as software vendors, system administrators, or coordinators. 
                        Second, CVSS scores are static; they do not change as new exploits appear or the threat landscape changes. 
                        Third, the scoring formula itself has not been clearly explained or tested, which reduces trust in the results. 
                        Research also shows that many high CVSS scores do not match real-world exploitation, and that experts often 
                        disagree on how to assign scores (Allodi &amp; Massacci, 2012; Allodi et al., 2018). In short, CVSS can give 
                        a false sense of accuracy while failing to guide practical decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I agree with these criticisms because vulnerability management is not only about severity but also about 
                        timing, context, and resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an alternative, Spring et al. (2021) suggest the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC). 
                        Unlike CVSS, SSVC does not rely on numbers. Instead, it uses decision trees that help different groups 
                        (suppliers, deployers, and coordinators) decide on actions such as ‚Äúimmediate,‚Äù ‚Äúout-of-cycle,‚Äù ‚Äúscheduled,‚Äù 
                        or ‚Äúdefer.‚Äù These trees consider factors like whether a vulnerability is being actively exploited, whether 
                        it affects critical missions or safety, and how exposed the system is. This makes SSVC more flexible and 
                        transparent than CVSS, as it matches the unique needs of different organisations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe SSVC should replace CVSS because it gives clearer, context-based advice. CVSS tries to be 
                        one-size-fits-all, but SSVC allows for different priorities and explains decisions in a way that is 
                        easier to understand. This makes it more useful for real-world vulnerability management.
                    </p>

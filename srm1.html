                    <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
                    <h3>Initial Post</h3>
                    <p>
                        Industry 4.0, as explained by Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019), is the new wave of digital change in business models, powered by technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). These tools allow humans and machines to communicate and work together in more decentralised ways, making a clear break from earlier industrial revolutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two examples show Industry 4.0 in practice. First, smart factories use IoT-enabled machines that share data in real time to improve production without human control. Second, big data analytics helps companies process huge amounts of data to make better decisions and provide customised services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The authors highlight six types of risks that come with digitalisation: technical problems, lack of staff skills (competence risks), low acceptance by employees, low acceptance by customers or partners, data privacy and security risks, and financial risks. For example, a manufacturer using IoT sensors could face a cyberattack that leaks sensitive information, damaging trust and costing money to fix. Another example is staff refusing to adopt AI tools because they fear losing jobs or are unsure how to use them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meindl and Mendon√ßa (2021) support these points. They found that the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and AI are central to Industry 4.0 but also bring bigger risks. These include more opportunities for cyberattacks, problems when systems cannot work well together, and the need for better digital skills among staff. As more devices are connected online, the chances of hacking increase, which matches Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó‚Äôs warning on data security. They also agree that if staff do not have the right skills, technology projects may fail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both studies show that while Industry 4.0 can bring big benefits, companies need strong plans to manage these risks from the beginning.

                    <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
                    <h3>Summary Post</h3>
                    <p>
                        From my post and the replies to Mohammed and Marina, I can see that Industry 4.0 gives businesses many benefits but also creates new risks. Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019) describe six main risks, such as technical problems, staff skills, low acceptance, financial costs, and data security. These risks came up often in our discussion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my first post, I gave examples like smart factories and big data. I also said that while these tools improve efficiency, they can fail if staff are not trained or if cyberattacks happen. Meindl and Mendon√ßa (2021) support this, saying that AI and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are powerful but also make systems more open to attacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mohammed‚Äôs post showed this clearly with the NotPetya attack (Greenberg, 2018) and cloud outages. I agreed with him that backup systems are important, but I also wondered if small companies can afford the same protection as big companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Marina focused on people and skills. Her example of the Renault ransomware attack (Reuters, 2017) and the German skills gap showed that staff training is just as important as technology. I asked if companies should reskill their current staff or hire new people with digital skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, I learned that Industry 4.0 is not only about new technology. Businesses also need to plan for risks, train staff, and think about long-term sustainability.

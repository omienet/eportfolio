                    <h2>Unit 4 Seminar</h2>
                    <h3>Risk Identification and Modelling - Case Study</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2022.103611" target="_blank">Case Study Source</a>: Threat modelling for industrial cyber physical systems (ICPS) in the era of smart manufacturing</p>

                    <p class="question">1. What are the key elements and interdependencies in a cyber-physical system that must be captured in a comprehensive threat model, and why are they critical for accurate risk analysis?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical Assets (Hardware Layer):</strong> Machines, sensors, actuators, controllers, production lines. These are the tangible assets attackers might disrupt, damage, or exploit (Jbair et al., 2022).</li>
                            <li><strong>Cyber Assets (Digital Layer):</strong> Software applications, PLC systems, control logic, communication protocols. Vulnerable to malware, replay attacks, unauthorized access (Jbair et al., 2022).</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication Networks (Connectivity Layer):</strong> Wired/wireless links, industrial IoT, fieldbus, OPC-UA, etc. Critical for understanding how threats propagate (Jbair et al., 2022).</li>
                            <li><strong>Data & Information Flows:</strong> Sensor data, control signals, manufacturing process data, logs. Must capture confidentiality, integrity, and availability risks (Jbair et al., 2022).</li>
                            <li><strong>Human & Organisational Actors:</strong> Operators, engineers, vendors, supply-chain partners. Human error, insider threats, and policy weaknesses are major attack vectors (NIST, 2023).</li>
                            <li><strong>Processes & Functional Dependencies:</strong> How assets work together (e.g., if one machine stops, the line halts). Dependencies must be understood for prioritising high-impact risks (ISA/IEC, n.d.).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Why these are critical:</em> Considering both physical and digital dependencies gives a full picture of possible failures, shows which threats are most serious, and reflects how the system evolves. It helps locate weak spots, plan protections, and adjust over time.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p class="question">2. How can threat modelling help identify attack entry points and system vulnerabilities in cyber-physical energy systems, and what are the challenges in doing so effectively?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p><strong>How threat modelling helps:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shows all system parts (sensors, control systems, networks) and where attackers might break in.</li>
                            <li>Maps possible attack paths (e.g., from a small device into the main control system).</li>
                            <li>Finds weak points like old software, weak passwords, or unsafe connections.</li>
                            <li>Helps prioritise risks, so the most dangerous ones are fixed first.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Very complex systems ‚Äì energy grids mix IT, physical equipment, and control networks.</li>
                            <li>Constant evolution ‚Äì new smart devices and renewable sources expand the attack surface.</li>
                            <li>Missing information ‚Äì not all parts or suppliers are visible.</li>
                            <li>Need for real-time operation ‚Äì systems cannot stop for security checks.</li>
                            <li>Human factors ‚Äì mistakes or insider threats are hard to model.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <p class="question">3. In the context of CPS threat modelling, how can scenario-specific metrics and risk assessment methodologies be used to prioritise vulnerabilities and guide the development of targeted security countermeasures?</p>
                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>By using metrics such as attack likelihood, downtime costs, or safety impact, organisations can compare which vulnerabilities are most serious. This allows prioritisation of high-risk weaknesses rather than treating all threats equally. Targeted countermeasures can then protect the most critical assets first, making security more effective and resource-efficient.</p>

                    <p>The STRIDE‚ÄìDREAD analysis reveals that all identified threats pose moderate to high levels of risk, with scores ranging between 31 and 35. The highest-rated threat is <strong>Tampering (35)</strong>, where manipulation of robotic arm commands could severely compromise safety and operational continuity. <strong>Spoofing (34)</strong> and <strong>Elevation of Privilege (34)</strong> also represent critical risks, as both can undermine trust in system data and allow unauthorized control. <strong>Denial of Service (33)</strong> ranks slightly lower but still presents significant disruption potential, while <strong>Information Disclosure (31)</strong>, though comparatively less severe, highlights the importance of safeguarding sensitive production data. These findings emphasize the need for robust technical and procedural countermeasures, such as strong authentication, encryption, access control mechanisms, and proactive network monitoring.</p>

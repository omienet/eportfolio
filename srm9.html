                    <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 2</h2>
                    <h3>Summary Post</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through this discussion, I have explored the limitations of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and considered whether alternatives such as the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC) or Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) could provide better solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my initial post, I agreed with Spring et al. (2021) that CVSS is overly focused on technical severity, produces static scores, and lacks transparency. This means it can mislead organisations, as many high CVSS scores do not reflect real-world exploitation (Allodi and Massacci, 2012; Allodi et al., 2018). I argued that SSVC is a stronger framework because it uses decision trees tailored to different stakeholders, providing context-specific, action-based outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In responding to Matthew, I appreciated his suggestion to combine CVSS with EPSS. EPSS predicts whether vulnerabilities will be exploited, which helps address CVSS‚Äôs blind spot. I noted that combining the two would help organisations prioritise effectively, such as patching medium CVSS vulnerabilities with high EPSS likelihoods before high CVSS vulnerabilities with low risk of exploitation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In responding to Ameirah, I supported her argument for SSVC as a replacement. I agreed that SSVC avoids the ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù approach of CVSS and suggested pairing SSVC with live threat intelligence to strengthen incident prevention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Matthew‚Äôs feedback on my own post raised an important point: although SSVC seems more effective, CVSS is deeply embedded in security practice through NIST and PCI DSS. He argued that a hybrid approach combining CVSS, SSVC, and EPSS may be more realistic, or that CVSS v4.0 could be combined with EPSS to improve prioritisation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, my learning has been that CVSS alone is insufficient. While SSVC offers the best decision-focused alternative, practical adoption may require hybrid models that integrate CVSS‚Äôs familiarity, EPSS‚Äôs predictive value, and SSVC‚Äôs contextual decision-making.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
                    <h3>Peer Response #1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mohammed, you explained Industry 4.0 very clearly, and I like the examples you used such as predictive maintenance and AI-assisted logistics. I agree that the benefits of Industry 4.0 come with serious risks, especially in cybersecurity and system reliability. The Maersk NotPetya attack you mentioned shows how connected systems can make problems spread quickly across the world (Greenberg, 2018). This matches what Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019) say about how heavy reliance on digital systems, without good risk planning, can turn strengths into weaknesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your example of the 2021 cloud outage is also important. It links well to the ‚Äútechnical‚Äù and ‚Äúfinancial‚Äù risk categories in the case study (Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó, 2019). One way to reduce this problem is to use a multi-cloud or hybrid setup, so companies are not dependent on just one provider. This is similar to your suggestion of redundancy planning, which can help businesses keep working even if one system fails.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think your point from Hermann et al. (2016) is also strong, as it shows risk management is not only about technology but also about rules, processes, and ethics. As you say, continuous staff training is key. This helps reduce the ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù and ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù risks the authors talk about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One question I have is: do you think smaller companies, with limited budgets, can realistically invest in both advanced cybersecurity and redundancy systems at the same level as larger companies? Or will Industry 4.0 mainly benefit businesses that already have strong resources?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, I agree that for Industry 4.0 to succeed, businesses must plan for risks from the start. Cybersecurity, backup systems, and skilled workers are all equally important.
                    </p>

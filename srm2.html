                    <h2>Collaborative Learning Discussion 1</h2>
                    <h3>Peer Response #1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mohammed, you explained Industry 4.0 very clearly, and I like the examples you used such as predictive maintenance and AI-assisted logistics. I agree that the benefits of Industry 4.0 come with serious risks, especially in cybersecurity and system reliability. The Maersk NotPetya attack you mentioned shows how connected systems can make problems spread quickly across the world (Greenberg, 2018). This matches what Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019) say about how heavy reliance on digital systems, without good risk planning, can turn strengths into weaknesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your example of the 2021 cloud outage is also important. It links well to the “technical” and “financial” risk categories in the case study (Kovaitė and Stankevičienė, 2019). One way to reduce this problem is to use a multi-cloud or hybrid setup, so companies are not dependent on just one provider. This is similar to your suggestion of redundancy planning, which can help businesses keep working even if one system fails.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think your point from Hermann et al. (2016) is also strong, as it shows risk management is not only about technology but also about rules, processes, and ethics. As you say, continuous staff training is key. This helps reduce the “competence” and “acceptance” risks the authors talk about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One question I have is: do you think smaller companies, with limited budgets, can realistically invest in both advanced cybersecurity and redundancy systems at the same level as larger companies? Or will Industry 4.0 mainly benefit businesses that already have strong resources?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, I agree that for Industry 4.0 to succeed, businesses must plan for risks from the start. Cybersecurity, backup systems, and skilled workers are all equally important.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Marina, you explained Industry 4.0 very clearly, and I like the way you used real examples such as smart manufacturing systems and predictive maintenance. Your example of the Renault ransomware attack (Renault, 2017) shows well how connected systems can be disrupted by cyberattacks. The German skills gap case is also a good choice, as it highlights how people and skills are just as important as technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your use of Oztemel and Gursev (2020) is strong because it supports the point that while Industry 4.0 improves efficiency, it can also make companies more vulnerable to risks such as hacking, supply chain problems, and staff training needs. This matches Kovaitė and Stankevičienė’s (2019) warning that risks must be managed carefully to keep sustainability goals on track.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One area I think could be explored more is how companies balance efficiency and sustainability. Sometimes businesses may focus on quick cost savings or faster production and delay investment in sustainability or long-term training. This can create extra risks, as new technologies might be adopted without thinking about their environmental or social impacts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your point on staff training raises another question: Do you think companies should put more effort into reskilling their current workers, or should they hire new employees with Industry 4.0 skills already in place? Each approach has different costs and effects on company culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, your post is well-written, supported by good sources, and clearly shows the link between Industry 4.0’s benefits and its risks.
